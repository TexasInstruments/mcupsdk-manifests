## Introduction

[MCU+ SDK MANIFESTS](https://github.com/TexasInstruments/mcupsdk-manifests) is

MCU+ SDK uses the [repo tool](https://gerrit.googlesource.com/git-repo) to
clone and manage multiple repositories. This repository contains manifest xml
files used with repo to clone MCU+ SDK components such as

- [MCU+ SDK Core](https://github.com/TexasInstruments/mcupsdk-core)
- [MCU+ SDK Setup](https://github.com/TexasInstruments/mcupsdk-setup)
- [Ethernet Low Level Driver (ENET LLD)](https://github.com/TexasInstruments/mcupsdk-enet-lld)
- [FreeRTOS-Kernel](https://github.com/TexasInstruments/mcupsdk-FreeRTOS-Kernel)
- [FreeRTOS-POSIX](https://github.com/TexasInstruments/mcupsdk-FreeRTOS-POSIX)
- [FreeRTOS-FAT](https://github.com/TexasInstruments/mcupsdk-FreeRTOS-FAT)
